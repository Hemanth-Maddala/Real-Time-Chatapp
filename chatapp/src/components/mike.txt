in chatarea we used the mike with speech to text conversion
there we used listening , reset of transcript, stopping
to enable mike:
    1. check the control pannel (to check whether microphone working or not)
        1. go to settings search for control pannel
        2. click on sound 
        3. go to recordings
        4. enable the microphone-array and set as default 
    2. check whether google was allowed to microphone in windows
        1. Give Chrome permission to access mic
        2. Open Settings → Privacy & security → Microphone
        3. Ensure Chrome is listed as a permitted app.
        4. Look for a section titled:
            “Let desktop apps access your microphone”(because chrome is desktop icon)
        5. Make sure it's set to ON.
    3. in localhost where your are using the microphone(in my case it is react)
        1. in our url:- http://localhost/5173 u can see info or lock icon 
        2. click on it 
        3. then open site settings and enable microphone
        4. which means that for that particular site the microphone permissionn was enabled
    4. chrome://settings/content/microphone use this to check which websites are using microphone
